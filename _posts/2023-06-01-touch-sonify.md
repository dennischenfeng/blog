Imagine you are blind and you need to understand a large amount of numerical data. If you were sighted, you would do some data visualization, like display the data in a scatter plot or a histogram or something similar. But without sight, what do you do?

# Existing methods

In broad strokes, the main ways to do this fall under a few categories: data sonification, textualization, and tactilization. (As opposed to data visualization.) 

Sonification is about producing audio to convey the information in a graph. So, picture a line plot where the y-value increases as you go from left to right. One way to sonify this is to play a audio tone that ascends in pitch. Or, if you instead have a sinusoidal plot, the sonification might play a audio tone that oscillates in pitch.
